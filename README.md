<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-R1000/recomputer_r_images/02.png" /></div>

## Mainboard Overview

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-R1000/recomputer_r_images/03.png" /></div>

## Power Diagram

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-R1000/recomputer_r_images/04.png" /></div>

The reComputer R1000 supports three power supply options: AC, DC terminal and PoE port. By default, the reComputer R1000 is powered through the AC/DC terminal (Official regional power adapter SKU:110061505/110061506), while **the PoE power supply(PoE module, SKU:110991925) is optional**. This provides flexibility in power supply selection and allows for easy integration with various power sources.

### 2-Pin Power terminal

<div align="center"><img width={300} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-R1000/recomputer_r_images/powerplug.png" /></div>

The reComputer R1000 is supplied with a nominal AC voltage of 12~24 V or DC voltage of 9~36V. The power supply is connected via the 2-pin power terminal block connector. To ground the reComputer R1000, the ground wire can be secured to the screw located at the top left corner of the power terminal.

### POE (optional)

With the PoE module installed, the ETH0 port of reComputer R1000 can support PoE power supply, providing a convenient and efficientway to power the device over Ethernet. This option simplifies the installation process and reduces the amount of cabling required, making it an ideal solution for applications with limited power sources or where power outlets are not readily available.

* PoE input: Range 44~57V; Typical 48V 
* PoE output: 12V, 1.1A Max.

> [!NOTE]
> It's worth noting that the PoE module provided with the reComputer R1000 is compliant with the IEEE 802.3af standard and can provide a maximum power supply of 12.95W. Therefore, if there is a need to connect high-power peripherals such as SSD or 4G modules, the PoE power supply may not be sufficient. In this case, it's recommended to use the AC/DC terminal for power supply instead to ensure stable and reliable operation of the device.

### Power Consumption

Please refer to the table below for the tested power consumption of reComputer R1000 in Seeed Studio's laboratory. Please note that this value is for reference only, as the test methods and environment can result in variations in the results.

| ACT           | Green          |        | Under Linux this pin will flash to signify eMMC access.<br /> If any error occurs during booting, then this LED will flash an <br />error pattern which can be decoded using the look up [table on the Raspberry Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#led-warning-flash-codes). |
| USER          | Green/Red/Blue |        | Need to be defined by user.                                  |
| RS485-1       | Green          | Off    | No data transfer on RS485 channel 1.                         |
|               |                | Blink  | RS485 channel 1 is receiveing or sending data.               |
| RS485-2       | Green          | Off    | No data transfer on RS485 channel 2.                         |
|               |                | Blink  | RS485 channel 2 is receiveing or sending data.               |
| RS485-3       | Green          | Off    | No data transfer on RS485 channel 3.                         |
|               |                | Blink  | RS485 channel 3 is receiveing or sending data.               |

<br/>

the ACT LED blinks in a regular four blink pattern, it cannot find bootcode (start.elf)
If the ACT LED blinks in an irregular pattern then booting has started.
If the ACT LED doesn't blink, then the EEPROM code might be corrupted, try again without anything connected to make sure. For more detail please check the Raspberry Pi forum:
STICKY: Is your Pi not booting? (The Boot Problems Sticky) - Raspberry Pi Forums

```

### RS485

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-R1000/recomputer_r_images/08.png" /></div>

The reComputer R1000 is equipped with 3 sets of RS485 interface using 3-pin connector, which is isolated for both signal and power to ensure safe and reliable operation in industrial and automation applications. The RS485A and RS485B signals are isolated using capacitive isolation, which provides excellent EMI immunity and meets the high-speed communication requirements of the RS485 interface.
By default, 120Œ© terminal resistors is not installed. However, the packaging box includes five surface-mount resistors. If needed, users should solder the resistor onto the device themselves.

> [!NOTE]
> The RS485 interface uses an isolated power supply, which means that the ground signal for external devices connected to the RS485 interface should be connected to the GND_ISO pin.

These are the pins related to the 485 interface of reComputer for the data table.

| RS485         | RS485_POWER_EN         | OS device file | P14         | default(High) |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| TX5           |                        | /dev/ttyAMA5   | GPIO12      |               |
| RX5           |                        |                | GPIO13      |               |
| TX2           | ID_SD                  | /dev/ttyAMA2   | GPIO0/ID_SD |               |
| RX2           | ID_SC                  |                | GPIO1/ID_SC |               |
| TX3           |                        | /dev/ttyAMA3   | GPIO4       |               |
| RX3           |                        |                | GPIO5       |               |
| RS485_1_DE/RE | (Hight/DE \|\| Low/RE) | /dev/ttyAMA2   | GPIO6       | default Low   |
| RS485_2_DE/RE |                        | /dev/ttyAMA3   | GPIO17      | default Low   |
| RS485_3_DE/RE |                        | /dev/ttyAMA5   | GPIO24      | default Low   |

By default, the power enable port of the RS485 port is high. And each RS485 interface is in the accepting state. You can do a simple experiment.

The 485 port that connects the pc to the reComputer-R.

Enter in the terminal of reComputer:

```
cat /dev/ttyAMA2
```

Then send some data in the serial debugging tool of your computer, you can observe the data in the terminal window of reComputer.

### Boot Switch

The Boot Switch of the reComputer R1000 is connected to the nRPI_BOOT pin of CM4. This switch provides users with the option to select the boot source between eMMC and USB. In normal mode, the switch should be set away from the side with the "BOOT" label, enabling the system to boot from eMMC. Conversely, when users need to flash the system image, they should set the switch towards the "BOOT" label, allowing the system to boot from the Type-C USB interface.

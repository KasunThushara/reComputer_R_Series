## Hardware Overview

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-R1000/recomputer_r_images/02.png" /></div>

## Mainboard Overview

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-R1000/recomputer_r_images/03.png" /></div>

## Power Diagram

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-R1000/recomputer_r_images/04.png" /></div>

The reComputer R1000 supports three power supply options: AC, DC terminal and PoE port. By default, the reComputer R1000 is powered through the AC/DC terminal (Official regional power adapter SKU:110061505/110061506), while **the PoE power supply(PoE module, SKU:110991925) is optional**. This provides flexibility in power supply selection and allows for easy integration with various power sources.

### 2-Pin Power terminal

<div align="center"><img width={300} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-R1000/recomputer_r_images/powerplug.png" /></div>

The reComputer R1000 is supplied with a nominal AC voltage of 12~24 V or DC voltage of 9~36V. The power supply is connected via the 2-pin power terminal block connector. To ground the reComputer R1000, the ground wire can be secured to the screw located at the top left corner of the power terminal.

### POE (optional)

With the PoE module installed, the ETH0 port of reComputer R1000 can support PoE power supply, providing a convenient and efficientway to power the device over Ethernet. This option simplifies the installation process and reduces the amount of cabling required, making it an ideal solution for applications with limited power sources or where power outlets are not readily available.

* PoE input: Range 44~57V; Typical 48V 
* PoE output: 12V, 1.1A Max.

> [!NOTE]
> It's worth noting that the PoE module provided with the reComputer R1000 is compliant with the IEEE 802.3af standard and can provide a maximum power supply of 12.95W. Therefore, if there is a need to connect high-power peripherals such as SSD or 4G modules, the PoE power supply may not be sufficient. In this case, it's recommended to use the AC/DC terminal for power supply instead to ensure stable and reliable operation of the device.

### Power Consumption

Please refer to the table below for the tested power consumption of reComputer R1000 in Seeed Studio's laboratory. Please note that this value is for reference only, as the test methods and environment can result in variations in the results.

| Status   | Voltage | Current | Power Consumption | Description |
|   ---      |    ---    |   ---      |         ---          |        ---    |
|Shutdown  |24V      |  51mA  |    1.224W         | Static power consumption test in shutdown and power-off state.|
|Idle      |24V      |  120mA |    2.88W          | To test the input current when supplying 24V power to the reComputer R1000 device without running any test programs.|
|Full Load |24V      |  230mA  |    5.52W          | Configure CPU to run at full load using the "stress -c 4" command. No external devices connected. |

### Power On and Power Off

The reComputer R1000 does not come with a power button by default, and the system will automatically start up once power is connect- ed. When shutting down, please select the shutdown option in the operating system and wait for the system to fully shut down before cutting off power. To restart the system, simply reconnect to the power.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that after shutting down, please wait for at least 10 seconds before restarting the system to allow for the internal capacitors to fully discharge.

To query GPIO mappings and offsets, please use following command:

```
cat /sys/kernel/debug/gpio
```
### LED Indicator Status

The reComputer R1000 features 6 LED indicators that serve to signal the machine's operational status. Please refer to the table below for the specific functions and status of each LED:

| LED Indicator | Color          | Status | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PWR           | Green          | On     | The device has been connected to power.                      |
|               |                | Off    | The device is not connnected to power.                       |
| ACT           | Green          |        | Under Linux this pin will flash to signify eMMC access.<br /> If any error occurs during booting, then this LED will flash an <br />error pattern which can be decoded using the look up [table on the Raspberry Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#led-warning-flash-codes). |
| USER          | Green/Red/Blue |        | Need to be defined by user.                                  |
| RS485-1       | Green          | Off    | No data transfer on RS485 channel 1.                         |
|               |                | Blink  | RS485 channel 1 is receiveing or sending data.               |
| RS485-2       | Green          | Off    | No data transfer on RS485 channel 2.                         |
|               |                | Blink  | RS485 channel 2 is receiveing or sending data.               |
| RS485-3       | Green          | Off    | No data transfer on RS485 channel 3.                         |
|               |                | Blink  | RS485 channel 3 is receiveing or sending data.               |

<br/>

the ACT LED blinks in a regular four blink pattern, it cannot find bootcode (start.elf)
If the ACT LED blinks in an irregular pattern then booting has started.
If the ACT LED doesn't blink, then the EEPROM code might be corrupted, try again without anything connected to make sure. For more detail please check the Raspberry Pi forum:
STICKY: Is your Pi not booting? (The Boot Problems Sticky) - Raspberry Pi Forums
For more detail please check the [Raspberry Pi forum](https://forums.raspberrypi.com//viewtopic.php?f=28&t=58151).

In this section we will use the raspi-gpio tool to test with GPIOs, you can use the raspi-gpio help to view the manual:

```
raspi-gpio help
```

1. The pin controlling the third LED of reComputer R1000 is gpio20. To get specific GPIO status, Please enter following command in the Terminal :

```
raspi-gpio get 20
```

2. Change the state of gpio20:

```
#set current pin state
sudo raspi-gpio set 20 dl
#get the pin state after set
raspi-gpio get 20
```

### Buzzer

The reComputer R1000 features an active buzzer, which can be used for various purposes such as alarm and event notifications. The buzzer is controlled through GPIO21 to CM4.

To turn off(on) the buzzer, Please enter following command in the Terminal :

```
# Turn off the buzzer using LED brightness
raspi-gpio set 21 op dl
# Turn on the buzzer using LED brightness
raspi-gpio set 21 op dh
```

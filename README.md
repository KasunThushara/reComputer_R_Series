## Mainboard Overview

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-R1000/recomputer_r_images/03.png" /></div>

## Power Diagram

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-R1000/recomputer_r_images/04.png" /></div>

The reComputer R1000 supports three power supply options: AC, DC terminal and PoE port. By default, the reComputer R1000 is powered through the AC/DC terminal (Official regional power adapter SKU:110061505/110061506), while **the PoE power supply(PoE module, SKU:110991925) is optional**. This provides flexibility in power supply selection and allows for easy integration with various power sources.

### 2-Pin Power terminal

<div align="center"><img width={300} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-R1000/recomputer_r_images/powerplug.png" /></div>

The reComputer R1000 is supplied with a nominal AC voltage of 12~24 V or DC voltage of 9~36V. The power supply is connected via the 2-pin power terminal block connector. To ground the reComputer R1000, the ground wire can be secured to the screw located at the top left corner of the power terminal.

### POE (optional)

With the PoE module installed, the ETH0 port of reComputer R1000 can support PoE power supply, providing a convenient and efficientway to power the device over Ethernet. This option simplifies the installation process and reduces the amount of cabling required, making it an ideal solution for applications with limited power sources or where power outlets are not readily available.

* PoE input: Range 44~57V; Typical 48V 
* PoE output: 12V, 1.1A Max.

> [!NOTE]
> It's worth noting that the PoE module provided with the reComputer R1000 is compliant with the IEEE 802.3af standard and can provide a maximum power supply of 12.95W. Therefore, if there is a need to connect high-power peripherals such as SSD or 4G modules, the PoE power supply may not be sufficient. In this case, it's recommended to use the AC/DC terminal for power supply instead to ensure stable and reliable operation of the device.

### RS485

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-R1000/recomputer_r_images/08.png" /></div>

The reComputer R1000 is equipped with 3 sets of RS485 interface using 3-pin connector, which is isolated for both signal and power to ensure safe and reliable operation in industrial and automation applications. The RS485A and RS485B signals are isolated using capacitive isolation, which provides excellent EMI immunity and meets the high-speed communication requirements of the RS485 interface.
By default, 120Œ© terminal resistors is not installed. However, the packaging box includes five surface-mount resistors. If needed, users should solder the resistor onto the device themselves.

> [!NOTE]
> The RS485 interface uses an isolated power supply, which means that the ground signal for external devices connected to the RS485 interface should be connected to the GND_ISO pin.

These are the pins related to the 485 interface of reComputer for the data table.

| RS485         | RS485_POWER_EN         | OS device file | P14         | default(High) |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| TX5           |                        | /dev/ttyAMA5   | GPIO12      |               |
| RX5           |                        |                | GPIO13      |               |

| RX2           | ID_SC                  |                | GPIO1/ID_SC |               |
| TX3           |                        | /dev/ttyAMA3   | GPIO4       |               |
| RX3           |                        |                | GPIO5       |               |
| RS485_1_DE/RE | (Hight/DE \|\| Low/RE) | /dev/ttyAMA2   | GPIO6       | default Low   |
| RS485_2_DE/RE |                        | /dev/ttyAMA3   | GPIO17      | default Low   |
| RS485_3_DE/RE |                        | /dev/ttyAMA5   | GPIO24      | default Low   |

By default, the power enable port of the RS485 port is high. And each RS485 interface is in the accepting state. You can do a simple experiment.

The 485 port that connects the pc to the reComputer-R.

Enter in the terminal of reComputer:

```bash
cat /dev/ttyAMA2
```

Then send some data in the serial debugging tool of your computer, you can observe the data in the terminal window of reComputer.

### Boot Switch

The Boot Switch of the reComputer R1000 is connected to the nRPI_BOOT pin of CM4. This switch provides users with the option to select the boot source between eMMC and USB. In normal mode, the switch should be set away from the side with the "BOOT" label, enabling the system to boot from eMMC. Conversely, when users need to flash the system image, they should set the switch towards the "BOOT" label, allowing the system to boot from the Type-C USB interface.


<div class="table-center">

| Switch Position                                              | Mode        | Description    | nRPI-BOOT |

</div>

### USB

The reComputer R1000 is equipped with one USB Type-C port and two USB Type-A ports. Please refer to the table below for their functions and descriptions.

| **Type**   | **Quantity** | **Protocol** | **Function** | **Description**                                              |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Type-C** | 1           | USB2.0       | USB-Device   | Used for serial port debugging, burning image, etc.          |
| **Type-A** | 2           | USB2.0       | USB-Host     | Connect different USB devices such as flash drives,<br /> USB keyboards or mouses. |

Check if the USB hub is detected by running the **lsusb** command. This command lists all connected USB devices, including hubs.

```bash
lsusb
```

Running this command should display information about the USB devices connected to your system, including any USB hubs that are present.

If the USB hub is functioning properly, you should see its details listed in the output of the **lsusb** command. If it's not listed, there may be an issue with the hub or its connection to the system. In such cases, you may need to troubleshoot the USB hub or its connections.

### SIM Slot

The reComputer R1000 uses a standard-size SIM card slot commonly found in industrial applications, which requires a standard SIM card with dimensions of 25mm x 15mm.

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that the standard version of reComputer R1000 does not come with a 4G module. If you require 4G functionality, an additional 4G module must be purchased separately.


### SSD Slot

The SSD slot on the reComputer R1000 is designed to accommodate NVMe M.2 2280 SSDs for 128GB, 256GB, 512GB and 1TB in capacity. This slot allows for high-speed storage expansion, enabling users to enhance the performance and capacity of their system.

To list the disks, including the SSD, you can use the fdisk -l command. Here's how:
 
```bash
sudo fdisk -l
```

This command will display a list of all disks connected to your system, including the SSD if it's properly detected. Look for entries that represent your SSD. They typically start with /dev/sd followed by a letter (e.g., /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, etc.).
Once you identify the entry corresponding to your SSD, you can proceed with partitioning or formatting it as needed.

> [!NOTE]
> There are two main uses for SSD cards:<br />
>- High Capacity Storage: SSD cards can be utilized for high-capacity storage needs.<br />
>- Boot Drive with Image: Another usage involves using the SSD both as a high-capacity storage and for storing system images, allowing booting directly from the SSD card.<br />
>- It's important to note that not all SSD cards available in the market support the second usage. Therefore, if you intend to use it as a boot drive and are unsure about which model to purchase, we recommend opting for our recommended 1TB SSD(SKU 112990267). This model has been tested and verified for boot functionality, reducing the risk of compatibility issues and minimizing trial and error costs.

The reComputer R1000 comes with two Ethernet RJ45 ports. ETH0 is a CM4 native Gigabit Ethernet interface that supports three different speeds: 10/100/1000 Mbit/s. An additional PoE module can be purchased to enable power-over-Ethernet (PoE) delivery through this interface, providing power to the reComputer R1000. Another one ETH1 supports 10/100 Mbit/s which is converted from USB.

### HDMI

The reComputer R1000 features a native HDMI interface from CM4, supporting up to 4K @ 60 fps video output. It is ideal for applications that require multiple displays, allowing users to output their content to external large screens.

### RTC

The reComputer R1000 features an RTC circuit that comes pre-installed with a CR2032 battery, enabling it to maintain timekeeping functionality even in the event of power loss.

To test the Real-Time Clock (RTC) functionality, follow these steps:
1. Disable automatic time synchronization:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop systemd-timesyncd
sudo systemctl disable systemd-timesyncd
```

2. Set the time to 12:00 PM on March 20, 2024:

```bash
sudo hwclock --set --date "2024-03-20 12:00:00"
```

3. Synchronize the RTC time to the system:

```bash
sudo hwclock --hctosys
```

4. Check the RTC time:

```bash
sudo hwclock -r
```


This command will read and display the time stored in the RTC.

5. Disconnect the power source from the RTC, wait a few minutes, then reconnect it and check the RTC time again to see if it retained the correct time.


### Watchdog

The reComputer R1000 comes equipped with an independent hardware watchdog circuit that ensures automatic system reboot in case of abnormal system crashes. The watchdog circuit is implemented through RTC and allows for flexible feeding times from 1 to 255 seconds.

To perform a watchdog test, follow these steps:

1. Install the watchdog software:

```bash
sudo apt install watchdog 
```

2. Edit the watchdog configuration file:

```bash
# make sure you install vim already, if haven't, can install by the command below
sudo apt-get install vim
sudo vim /etc/watchdog.conf
```

Modify the configuration as follows:

```bash
watchdog-device		= /dev/watchdog
# Uncomment and edit this line for hardware timeout values that differ
# from the default of one minute.vi
watchdog-timeout	= 120
# If your watchdog trips by itself when the first timeout interval
# elapses then try uncommenting the line below and changing the
# value to 'yes'.
#watchdog-refresh-use-settimeout	= auto
# If you have a buggy watchdog device (e.g. some IPMI implementations)
# try uncommenting this line and setting it to 'yes'.
#watchdog-refresh-ignore-errors	= no
# ====================== Other system settings ========================
#
# Interval between tests. Should be a couple of seconds shorter than
# the hardware time-out value.
interval		= 15
max-load-1		= 24
#max-load-5		= 18
#max-load-15		= 12
realtime		= yes
priority		= 1
```

You can adjust other settings as needed.
3. Ensure the watchdog service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl start watchdog
```

4. To test the watchdog functionality, execute the following command to simulate a system hang:

```bash
sudo su
echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
echo "c" > /proc/sysrq-trigger
```
> [!WARNING]
> This command triggers a kernel crash and should cause the watchdog to reboot the system.

5. Monitor the system to confirm that it reboots after the specified timeout period.
These steps will help you test and ensure the functionality of the watchdog timer on your system.

The reComputer R1000 mainboard features two Mini-PCIe slots. Mini-PCIe slot 1 supports 4G module, LoRa¬Æ module using the USB protocol and Zigbee module using USB protocol; while Mini-PCIe slot 2 supports LoRa¬Æ module using the USB and SPI protocol and Zigbee module using USB protocol. Additionally, 4G module and LoRa¬Æ¬Æ module shouldn't be used at the same time, can not plug in two LoRa¬Æ modules on board. 

> [!NOTE]
> Can not plug in 2 LoRa¬Æ modules on board.


### Wi-Fi/BLE

The reComputer R1000-10 is powered by the CM4 with an onboard Wi-Fi/BLE version, providing the same Wi-Fi/BLE parameters as the CM4. For detailed parameter information, please refer to the Raspberry Pi official website.

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to note that due to the reComputer R1000's metal casing, Wi-Fi/BLE signals may have difficulty penetrating the metal exterior. If you require Wi-Fi/BLE functionality, it is recommended to purchase an external antenna and [click here for assemble instruction](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/recomputer_r1000_hardware_guide/#assemble-wi-fible-antenna).


#### Connect wifi

Step 1. To scan for Wi-Fi networks:

```bash
nmcli dev wifi list
```

Step 2. Connect to the wifi network:

```bash
sudo nmcli dev wifi connect network-ssid password "network-password"
sudo nmcli --ask dev wifi connect network-ssid 
#If you don't want to write your password on the screen, you can use the --ask option.
```

Step 3. After the device is powered on, it will automatically connect to wifi. If you want to delete the saved WiFi information:

```bash
nmcli con del network-ssid
```

After the connection is disconnected, connect to another wifi.

#### Connect bluetooth devices

Before adding a Bluetooth device, the Bluetooth service on your computer must be started and running. You can check this with the systemctl command.

```bash
sudo systemctl status bluetooth
```

If the Bluetooth service status is not active, you must enable it first. Then start the service so that it starts automatically when you start your device.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
sudo systemctl start bluetooth
```

You can use the bluetoothctl tool to connect and manage Bluetooth, the following are some common commands and comments:

```bash
#Scan attachments to the device
bluetoothctl scan on

#To make your Bluetooth adapter discoverable to other devices, use the following command:
bluetoothctl discoverable on


#Replace A4:C1:38:F4:83:2E below with the Media Access Control (MAC) address you want to connect to
#Pair a new Bluetooth device
bluetoothctl pair A4:C1:38:F4:83:2E

#Connect previously paired devices
bluetoothctl connect A4:C1:38:F4:83:2E

#View the list of devices paired with the system
bluetoothctl paired-devices

#When a Bluetooth device is trusted, the system automatically connects to it after discovering it
bluetoothctl trust A4:C1:38:F4:83:2E

#Cancel trust
bluetoothctl untrust A4:C1:38:F4:83:2E

#Remove a paired Bluetooth device
bluetoothctl remove A4:C1:38:F4:83:2E

#Disconnect the Bluetooth connection, but do not remove it from the paired list
bluetoothctl disconnect A4:C1:38:F4:83:2E

#Block specific devices from connecting to your system
bluetoothctl block A4:C1:38:F4:83:2E

#Unblock device
bluetoothctl unblock A4:C1:38:F4:83:2E


#Use interactive mode and exit
bluetoothctl
exit 
```
